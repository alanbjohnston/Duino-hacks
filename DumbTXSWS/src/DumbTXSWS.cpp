   Really Dumb Transmit-only Software Serial Implementation.
   Copyright 2020 By Bill Westfield (WestfW@yahoo.com)

This is aimed mainly at the new crop of fast ARM-based Arduinos that
don't implement SoftwareSerial, because they have "many" hardware serial
interfaces, but nevertheless might have cause to send data on some other pin.
